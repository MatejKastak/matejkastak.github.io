Wayland has been praised for its security.
On one hand it can be a good thing but on the other hand it can make other things more difficult.
One of those things is streaming or recording in wayland session.
This is not currently supported out of the box.

# Recording

[Wf-recorder](https://github.com/ammen99/wf-recorder) is the only program I have tried and it works well out of the box.

# Streaming

TBD
