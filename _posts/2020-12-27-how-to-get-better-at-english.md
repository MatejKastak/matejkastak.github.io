In this post I will document my journey/progression in writing and what I have
learned along the way.

The current state as of writing this instruction is not as good. I feel pretty
confident understanding English in any form by I severely lack when it comes to
speaking and writing.

Most of the time I am reading English. As a programmer there is a lot of focus
on understanding written or spoken English. Apart from writing some simple
documentation there is not much need for me to write or speak in English.

So as one of my goals I have selected improving in this area. I will need to
write and defend a thesis in English so I see it as a good investment. Also it
will force me to go outside of my comfort zone and express myself more.

# Starting a blog

As a first challenge I set for myself was to start a blogging. Pretty simple way to
host a blog like site is using [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/). And
since I had previous experience it was not hard to set it up.

# Streaming

The next task was to get more used to speaking and thinking in English more.
For me the most natural way to try this is stream programming on
[twitch](twitch.tv).
